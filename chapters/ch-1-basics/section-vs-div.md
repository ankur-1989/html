# Differences Between `<section>` and `<div>` Tags in HTML

### 1. Semantic Meaning

- **`<section>`**: Represents a thematically grouped content area.
- **`<div>`**: A generic container with no inherent semantic meaning.

### 2. Document Structure

- **`<section>`**: Contributes to the document's outline and typically includes a heading.
- **`<div>`**: Does not affect the document structure.

### 3. Accessibility

- **`<section>`**: Provides additional context to screen readers and assistive technologies, enhancing accessibility.
- **`<div>`**: Lacks semantic information, offering no accessibility advantages by itself.

### 4. SEO Implications

- **`<section>`**: Clearly defines content areas, which may benefit search engine optimization (SEO).
- **`<div>`**: Does not inherently impact SEO.

### 5. Usage Context

- **`<section>`**: Suitable for larger, distinct blocks of content.
- **`<div>`**: Ideal for smaller groupings or for applying styles using CSS.

### 6. HTML5 Introduction

- **`<section>`**: Introduced as a semantic element in HTML5.
- **`<div>`**: Available in earlier versions of HTML and remains a flexible, non-semantic container.
