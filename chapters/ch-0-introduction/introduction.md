## HTML Syntax

HTML documents are written using **elements** or **tags**. Tags are written inside angle brackets (`<>`), often with an opening and closing pair.

### Basic Structure of an HTML Document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of tags:

* "<!Doctype html>" :  Declares the document type as HTML5
* "`<html>`": the root element of the HTML document.
* "`<head>`": contains the metadata and links to styles and scripts.
* "`<title>`": defines the title of the webpage (visible in browser tab)
* "`<body>`": contains the content displayed on the webpage.
* "`<h1>": A heading tag: used for the main heading of the page.`
* "`<p>`": a pargraph tag; used to define the blocks of text.
* "<`a>`": An anchor tag; used to create hyperlinks.
